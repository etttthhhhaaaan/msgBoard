    description: [
      `I've been writing code since 9th grade, and have been a computer engineering student my entire time at The Ohio State University.`,
      `Everyone always gets hit with the question, "why do you like coding? why are you in this field? When I was five, my dad got me a gift: a Saturn V rocket model kit, which my mom thought was too advanced for me at the time. However, to their surprise, when they came home from work one day I had it completely done. I had so much fun putting that little model rocket together that I had sat down for five hours, doing nothing but building - putting little blocks together and watching a project come to life.`,
      `I have been fortunate enough to discover that my passion in this life is building, and watching things come to life. Even now, when I pull all nighters for a project, or am simply writing code for a lab, I experience those tiny twinges of excitment, reminscent of that day almost 17 years ago, as my projects come to life.`,
      `Every time I submit code, push to master, and report my discoveries to my team, I feel like a puzzle piece has fallen into place.`,
